  "summary": "REQ-3 is implemented via a new shared helper that scans stages by smallest stageNumber to resolve an origin serial and formats team labels with a hyphenated prefix. Knockout views (KnockoutPage/FullSchedulePage) were updated to prefix real teams while preserving placeholders. Robin Round 2 match team display was updated (via roundRobinDisplayCode) to use the origin serial for stageNumber===2, but the diff is truncated for the main RoundRobinGroupTable UI so it’s unclear whether *all* Robin Round 2 team occurrences (e.g., group tables) now consistently render the prefixed format.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "In Robin Round 2, any team displayed (including match listings) shows its originating group serial number in the format \"<OriginGroup>-<OriginPosition> <TeamName>\".",
      "reason": "The diff shows Robin Round 2 match formatting updated in frontend/src/features/tournament/roundRobinDisplayCode.ts, but the Robin Round 2 group/team table component change is truncated and does not show actual rendering using the origin serial prefix. Therefore it cannot be confirmed that all Robin Round 2 UI locations (beyond match listings) were updated.",
