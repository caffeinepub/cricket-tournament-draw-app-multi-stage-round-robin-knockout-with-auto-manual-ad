  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented via cumulative group-name offset during stage generation. REQ-2/REQ-3 appear implemented via an editable group header UI calling a new store action (updateGroupName) that returns success/error and shows toast feedback. REQ-4 cannot be fully verified from the provided truncated diff because the serial-number rendering format and presence of the position dropdown specifically for Robin Round 2 are not shown end-to-end (though updateTeamPosition + Select imports suggest the dropdown exists).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Ensure Robin Round 2 groups show the same team serial numbering format \"{groupName}-{position}\" and the same dropdown control to rearrange team positions as in Robin Round 1; and after a group rename, serial numbers update to use the new group name.",
      "reason": "RoundRobinGroupTable.tsx is truncated before the team-row rendering portion; the diff summary shows position changing logic and Select imports, but does not provide direct evidence that (a) the serial string \"{groupName}-{position}\" is rendered for all stages including Round 2, and (b) the dropdown is present for all stages including Round 2, and (c) serials recompute based on renamed group name.",
