# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix tournament loading so that saved tournament data properly populates on the tournament setup page.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix the tournament loading flow in TournamentListDialog to ensure loaded tournament data (name, teams, groups, stages, advancement configurations) populates correctly on the tournament setup page
- Ensure the tournament setup page displays loaded data in an editable state after loading

**User-visible outcome:** When loading a saved tournament from the Manage Tournament dialog, users will see all tournament data populate on the setup page, allowing them to view and edit the loaded tournament configuration.
